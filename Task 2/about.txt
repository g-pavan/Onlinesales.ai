Task 2: Evaluate Multiple Mathematical Expressions Using a Web API

Approach:
1. Read mathematical expressions from a text file.
2. Initialize an aiohttp ClientSession to handle HTTP requests to the API.
3. Send a batch of expressions to the math.js API for evaluation.
4. Print the results of each expression on the console.
5. Measure the total execution time for evaluating all expressions.

Code Explanation:
- The code begins by defining the 'evaluate_expressions' function for making API requests.
- The 'main' function serves as the entry point for the application.
- Mathematical expressions are read from a text file line by line until "end" is encountered.
- Expressions are collected in a list for batch evaluation.
- The 'evaluate_expressions' function sends a POST request to the API with the list of expressions.
- The API responds with evaluated results for each expression, which are printed on the console.
- The execution time is measured to evaluate the performance of the application.

Handling 'end' Separator:
- The code handles the 'end' separator to evaluate expressions in sets.
- Expressions are collected until 'end' is encountered in the text file.
- When 'end' is found, the expressions collected so far are sent for evaluation.
- This allows for efficient processing of a large number of expressions.

Performance Metrics:
- The code calculates the total execution time to evaluate all expressions.
- This provides insights into how efficiently the application processes requests.

To Run the Code:
- Ensure that you have Python installed and aiohttp library available.
- Create a 'expressions.txt' file with mathematical expressions.
- Run the code, and it will read and evaluate expressions from the file.

Task Completion:
- The code successfully evaluates mathematical expressions using the math.js API.
- It handles 'end' separators, making it suitable for processing a large number of expressions.

Improvements:
- To enhance performance, consider parallelizing requests or using a dedicated math library for local evaluation.
- Implement error handling for API requests and responses.
